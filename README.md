# KundlInsights

KundlInsights is a production-grade iOS and Android application for **Vedic / Jyotish astrology**.

It is intentionally being built in layers, beginning with a deterministic astronomical calculation foundation and progressing through charting, dashas, transits, Ashtakavarga, event analysis, prediction, interpretation, mobile delivery, and subscriptions.

## Astrology commitment

KundlInsights uses only the following astrology standard:

- Vedic / Jyotish, with Parashari as the primary framework
- Sidereal zodiac using Lahiri / Chitrapaksha ayanamsha
- 27 Nakshatras, Vimshottari Dasha, Vedic Drishti, SAV/BAV Ashtakavarga, and Vedic divisional charts

It does not use tropical zodiac, Western house systems, Western aspects, or Western interpretation rules.

The authoritative technical and domain decisions are documented in [docs](docs/).

## Current status

Layers 1–14A are implemented. Layer 14A converts approved Layer 13 Career conclusions into an immutable deterministic reading contract with controlled template keys, exact statuses, source/evidence references, temporal context, and disclosures. It generates neither free-form prose nor predictions. See [LAYER-13C2-CLASSICAL-CAREER-EVENT-PREDICATES.md](docs/LAYER-13C2-CLASSICAL-CAREER-EVENT-PREDICATES.md) and [LAYER-14A-DETERMINISTIC-READING-CONTRACT.md](docs/LAYER-14A-DETERMINISTIC-READING-CONTRACT.md).
